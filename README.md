# Anti-Sleep-Alarm-System-
Designed and developed an IoT-based system to prevent drivers from falling asleep while driving by monitoring eye blink patterns. Utilized sensors like an IR sensor and microcontroller (Arduino) to detect drowsiness and trigger an alarm. Simulated the system using Proteus software and implemented the code in Arduino IDE for real-time performance.
